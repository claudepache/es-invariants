## Integraty checks on Proxies

Very soon here: Identifying the necessary and invariant checks on [Proxies] (https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-proxy-object-internal-methods-and-internal-slots)
in order to maintain the [invariants of internal methods] (https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-invariants-of-the-essential-internal-methods)
as modelled in _[invariants.md] (/claudepache/es-invariants/blob/master/invariants.md)_.
